== Definition

A template engine is a class capable of render a specific template language resource, with the properties and message resources provided to the template instance.

Is an implementation class of the link:apidocs/cat/albirar/template/engine/service/ITemplateEngine.html[`cat.albirar.template.engine.service.ITemplateEngine`] interface.

Since version `3.0.0`, a factory is used to render templates. This factory is responsible of find and delegate the render call to a registered template engine.

Library ships with a link:https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/thymeleafspring.html[Thymeleaf Spring Dialect] template engine that is auto-registered.

You can add more template engines by adding the corresponding jar to the classpath and configure and register them.

== Add a new template engine to your project

In your project, among other libraries, you should to add a dependency to the template engine jar that you want to use.

In your configuration, you should to add the template engine class on the class collection to _scan_ by Spring.

The template engine class should to register itself on factory.

That's all! You can use templates in the language that the selected template engines can manage.

== Develop a new template engine

=== Dependencies

Among the other dependencies you need, the `albirar-template-engine` jar dependency should to be added to your project (see link:dependency-info.html[dependency info])

=== Implementation

Create a class that implement the link:apidocs/cat/albirar/template/engine/service/ITemplateEngine.html[`cat.albirar.template.engine.service.ITemplateEngine`]. Implement the methods as needed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Your class should to be associated with a specific template language. An identifier is required to do so.
A curated selection of identifier string should to be made. In case of `Thymeleaf` with `Spring dialect`, the identifier is `thymeleaf-spring` and is defined as a constant at class link:apidocs/cat/albirar/template/engine/service/impl/ThymeleafSpringTemplateEngineImpl.html[`cat.albirar.template.engine.service.impl.ThymeleafSpringTemplateEngineImpl`].
====

Is a good practice to expose publicly the string constant with the defined identifier. So, users of your template engine can reference directly this identifier.

=== Registration

To register a template engine, should to call the `register` method on link:apidocs/cat/albirar/template/engine/service/ITemplateEngineRegistry.html[`cat.albirar.template.engine.service.ITemplateEngineRegistry`] registry object:

[source, java]
----
    // ...
    @Autowired 
    private ITemplateEngineRegistry registry;
    
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        registry.register(this);
    }
    // ...
----

[TIP]
====
It's recommended that the class itself do the registration automatically, on construction time, to avoid the need of registration by users.
====

In the above example, the template engine class implement the life-cycle interface `org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean` in order to register itself as a new template engine.

=== Configuration

If your template engine needs any kind of configuration, you should to create a `Configuration` class, eligible to import by configuration classes of users.

[WARNING]
====
Although you can register your template with the configuration class, it's not recommended so in future versions of `albirar-template-engine`, the registration can be made in a different moment of configuration.

It's better that template engine class do a self-registration on initializing bean.
